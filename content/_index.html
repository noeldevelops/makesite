<h1>Hi, I'm Noel. <br>I design & develop software.</h1>

<p>I really enjoy creating beautiful, high-quality, people-oriented software. I'm currently a Senior Frontend Engineer
    at <a href="https://noteable.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Noteable.io</a>, where I'm developing UI
    components that make collaborating on data analysis easier.</p>

<p>In my spare time I like to do arts & crafts, wander in the woods with my dogs, and read everything I can get my hands
    on.</p>
